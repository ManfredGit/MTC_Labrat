# Labrat Reporting Service 


Labrat is a Clinical Study platform that enables the management of health-related interventions that are targeted to evaluate health effects and outcomes for a specific control group of participants. The platform facilitates resource scheduling, participant and equipment management, as well as device data and telemetry storage configuration.

The Reporting Service contains a PowerBI report to help visualize Clinical Study data, that can be published into a PowerBI collection and Workspace in your Azure Subscription.
